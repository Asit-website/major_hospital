            <p>
              Surgical Gastroenterology offers cutting-edge treatment for
              individuals with gastrointestinal disorders that need surgical
              intervention. We provide sophisticated laparoscopic surgical
              methods to individuals suffering from gastrointestinal problems
              such as cancer. Patients may have oncologically sound procedures
              using minimally invasive techniques, resulting in a quicker
              recovery and return to regular life.

            <h2>When Should you consult with a gastroenterologist</h2>
            <p>
              If you have unexplained blood in your stool, trouble swallowing,
              or are suffering stomach discomfort, your primary care doctor may
              send you to a gastroenterologist. People over the age of fifty
              should see a gastroenterologist as a preventative step. People
              over the age of fifty are more likely to get colon cancer.

            <h4>
              Several surgical methods, depending on the circumstances of each
              patient, may be used, including:
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Endoscopic surgery: Endoscopic surgery involves the surgeon
                inserting an endoscope via the mouth, nose, or other natural
                bodily openings to reach the treatment region.
              </li>
              <li>
                Laparoscopic surgery involves the physician making a tiny
                incision on the body and inserting a thin, flexible tube known
                as a laparoscope to conduct surgery. A lit camera is also
                included with the laparoscope.
              </li>
              <li>
                Robotic surgery: Robotic surgery provides more precision,
                control, and accuracy than human hands. As a result, it may be
                utilised for complicated and sensitive operations. In addition,
                the surgeon uses a console that offers a high-definition,
                magnified image of the operative site.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Follow the doctorâ€™s or nurseâ€™s instructions: Before the operation,
              your doctor will usually inform you of what you should and should
              not eat or drink. They may also advise you to discontinue some of
              your medications prior to surgery. You must adhere to all
              instructions given to you while preparing for surgery. Plan ahead
              of time for the day of surgery and the days following: Ascertain
              that you have someone who can drive you to the operation and
              return you home once it is over. The period after surgery is also
              crucial. Have someone assist you during this period to ensure a
              quick recovery. Make preparations to handle the following items in
              your home space: It is critical to prepare ahead of time if you
              will be able to walk the stairs, use the restroom, or make meals.
              You may also need physical rehabilitation after surgery. Make a
              plan for where youâ€™ll be doing it.

            What can I anticipate during my recuperation after gastrointestinal surgery?

            <p>
            The amount of time it will take you to recuperate depends on the operation and how extensive it was. If it was a minor operation, such as a colonoscopy, you may resume your normal activities immediately. If you have an invasive surgery, you will need some time to recover and manage your pain. However, it is best to consult with your doctor about what to anticipate throughout the healing process.
